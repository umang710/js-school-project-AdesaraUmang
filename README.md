# Timeline of Computer Gaming

## Overview

This is a basic HTML project that shows a timeline of important events in the history of computer gaming. The main focus so far has been on getting the structure right using semantic HTML.

## Whatâ€™s Done

- Added a header with a title, logo placeholder, and theme toggle.
- Created a main section with a placeholder for future filters.
- Set up a timeline section that includes individual events with images and captions.
- Used `<figure>` and `<img>` to visually represent each event.
- Added a footer for consistency.
